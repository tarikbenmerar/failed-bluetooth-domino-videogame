## A failed video game development of a Bluetooth based Multiplayer Domino Videogame from 2008

This repository is a failed attempt to build a multiplayer Bluetooth based Domino Videogame using Java Micro Edition. 

## The story behind game

The mobiles at that time had support of bluetooth networks and wanted to explore its usage, this game was attempt to explore the Bluetooth API in Java Micro Edition. I had some struggles working with the API and learning from the documentation, so the experimentation didn't go through.
